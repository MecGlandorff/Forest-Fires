# Forest Fire Prediction with SVC
A project predicting forest fires using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and meteorological data.  


## Intro
Forest fires suck. This project uses machine learning to classify whether a fire will occur based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Details:** Covers forest fire data from Montesinho, Portugal, including weather indices and burn areas.  
- **Key Features:** Temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall, and fire weather indices (e.g., FFMC, DMC).  

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forest-fire-prediction.git

## Install dependencies:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

Add the dataset:
Place forestfires.csv in the data directory.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook as if it is main.py, no need to do anything with the modules.
